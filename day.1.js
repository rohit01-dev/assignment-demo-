To create a function in JavaScript that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum, you can use the following code:

```javascript
function sum(num1, num2) {
  var result = num1 + num2;
  return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(sum(10, 20)); // Output: 30
console.log(sum(5, -2)); // Output: 3
```

In this code, the `sum` function takes two parameters, `num1` and `num2`, and calculates their sum using the `+` operator. The result is stored in the `result` variable and returned using the `return` statement. 

To test the function, you can call it using two numbers as arguments and print the returned result using `console.log`.
