Sure, here's the JavaScript code to create an array called "fruits" with the mentioned fruits:

```javascript
var fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "mango"];
``` 

In this code, we declare a variable called "fruits" and assign it an array of strings containing the fruits. The syntax for creating an array in JavaScript is to surround a comma-separated list of values with square brackets.
