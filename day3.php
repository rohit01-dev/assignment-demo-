/*If you want to print the multiplication table of a given number using a for loop in PHP, you can use the following code:/*

```php
<?php
$number = 5; // Change this value to print the multiplication table of another number

echo "Multiplication table of $number:\n";

for ($i = 1; $i <= 10; $i++) {
    $result = $number * $i;
    echo "$number * $i = $result\n";
}
?>
```

/*In this code, you can set the `$number` variable to any desired integer to print its multiplication table. The for loop (`for ($i = 1; $i <= 10; $i++)`) iterates through values from 1 to 10 and calculates the product of the given number and the current value of the iterator `$i`. The result is then printed using `echo`./*
